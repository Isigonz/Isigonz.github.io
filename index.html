			<h2>Unit 2</h2>
			<p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-6-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>
n this unit I learned many things about code. I learned how to code things like listed itmes and tables. I also learned how to place videos into code. We were prompted to make a video and then create a page to put it in code. Along with that we learned different aspects of code. I learned the importance of typing in all the code how it should go and the function of each element.</p> <br>
		<ul>
			<li>The functionality of each code element.</li>
			<li>How to code video into a page of code.</li>
			<li>Being able to code tables with numerous columns.</li>
		</ul>
			
			<h2>Unit 3</h2>
			<p class="temp">This unit consisted of learning how to stle our index page using CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This allows me to make changes to my index page, without moving importaintinformation around to much. I can add things like fonts, colors, and borders to my page. Now I can make my pages more pleasing to eye, and add elemnts that make it easier for the user to navigate my page. </p>
			
			<h2>Unit 4</h2>
			<p class="temp">Unit 4 tought me how to create images and then be able to place them into my website. Not only can I create my own images on photoshop, I can also take photos and place them into my website. First I made a small photo gallery. I did this my taking my own photos, putting them onto my computer and them coding them into my site. From that, I learned some basic selsction skills in photoshop. Those skills allowed me to take elements from different images and put them together in one banner. Using previous coding knowledge, I made a banner to fit my site and coded it in. </p>
			
			<h2>Unit 5</h2>
			<p class="temp">In this unit, it was important to understand functions. In order for something to happen or for n action to take place, there must be a command. Not only does there need to be a command, but also a reciever of that command. This comes in handy especially when you want to add elements such as buttons. You need to tell the button what to do and when to do it. If the commands and funtions don't work right away, then you need to make sure that the communcication between command and reciever are working smoothly.</p>
			
			<h2>Unit 6</h2>
			<p class="temp">Unit 6 was an important unit. In this unit we learned about javascript, and forms. We learned how we could add forms into our websites. These forms consisted of text boxes, buttons, and in some cases drop dowm menus. We looked at examples of some already existing forms. The forms we loked at had radion buttons and drop down menus. Also, the form wa programmed to add prices and give an estimated total. It came time to put forms into our own website. I added a name and email text box for the user to type into. I then added a radio butto with two options. Lastly I added a dropdown menu with three options. Now I will be able to add forms to future websites. </p>
			
			<h2>Unit 7</h2>
